# Bulldozer Price Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to predict the sale prices of bulldozers using machine learning. The dataset is sourced from the **Blue Book for Bulldozers**, containing historical auction prices for various bulldozer models. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the price based on factors like machine type, manufacturing year, and usage.
